# Association Rule  
Discovering rules that indicate the likely occurance of an item based on the occurrences of other items in the transaction  
### Fundamentals:  
- Set theory :  
    - A set is a collection of objects  
    E.g., set A = {1,2,3}  
    - An element in a set is counted only once  
    E.g., A = {1,2,2,3}--> set A = {1,2,3}  
    - There is no order of elements in a set  
    E.g., {1,2,3} = {3,1,2}  
- Important terms:  
    - Itemset : A collection of one or more items  
    - Support : Fraction of transactions that contain an itemset
