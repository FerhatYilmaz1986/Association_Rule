# Association Rule  
Discovering rules that indicate the likely occurance of an item based on the occurrences of other items in the transaction  
### Fundamentals:  
- Set theory :  
    - A set is a collection of objects  
    E.g., set A = {1,2,3}  
    - An element in a set is counted only once
    E.g., A = {1,2,2,3}--> set A = {1,2,3}
